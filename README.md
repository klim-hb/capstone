# Capstone - MovieLens
Capstone Project for HarvardX (Data Science) 

This project aims to analyze the provided MovieLens dataset and to compare various types of approaches for a recommendation system, as well as various reasons for the limitation of such analysis.

The report consists of the following parts:
* Overview section describes the dataset and summarizes the goal of the project and key steps that were
performed;
* Methods section explains the process and techniques used, including data cleaning, data exploration and
visualization, insights gained, and modeling approach;
* Results section that presents the modeling results and discusses the model performance for the Linear Model
and Factorization Model;
* Validation section provides insight on results of validation for Linear Model;
* Conclusion section that gives a summary of the report, the limitations and future research.

**Key findings (RMSE):**
The paper used various methods of data analysis to find the optimal RMSE value. Upon concluding the
analysis, the best RMSE result for Linear Model was achieved at **0.8648177** and **0.7851291** for the factorization method by recosystem. As part of the course requirement, only the Linear model was examined
with the validation dataset. Furthermore, the validation dataset was only used once at the final point of the
Linear model.
